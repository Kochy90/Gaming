/**
 * Split
 * This is the opposite of a straight Bet. Instead of betting on one number, youâ€™re placing a Bet on the line that separates two numbers.
 * If either number comes up, you win. Examples of wagers you can make include: 1|2, 2|5, 13|14, 13|16, 25|26, 26|27, 27|30.
 * As long as the two numbers sit next to each other, you can split a Bet between them. This pays 17:1.
